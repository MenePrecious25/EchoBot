🛠️ Customization
Modifying Responses
You can easily customize the responses by editing the chatbot's logic in app.py. For example, you can use dictionaries or rule-based logic to create responses:

python
Copy code
# Example response logic
if user_input.lower() == "hello":
    response = "Hi there! How can I assist you today?"
else:
    response = "I'm still learning. Can you rephrase that?"
Adding More Logic
Feel free to expand the response logic using more advanced conditions or integrate API calls to make the chatbot smarter.
